Bayesian Logistic Regression with PCA and SVM Analysis

Welcome to the Bayesian Logistic Regression with PCA and SVM repository. This repository contains Python code and resources for performing advanced machine learning analyses on a dataset related to predicting divorce. The primary focus is to replicate and extend previous research using methods such as Bayesian logistic regression, PCA (Principal Component Analysis), and SVM (Support Vector Machine).

Repository Structure
